## Project Data

data for this project will be available following manuscript submission at the [link provided](https://www.google.com)

## Project Outline

this project is organized in to initial preprocessing folders for certain types of data formats

_raw imaging files_ - cortical imaging frames are acquired using the SciMedia MiCAM Ultima system. Dual-camera acquired files are separated to individual cameras using the dual_cnv software from BV_tools

_voltage imaging files_ - after preprocessing, imaging files are converted to voltage images using a ratiometric equalization described in Carrandini et al. 2015

_raw behavioral traces and trial results_ - output from custom labview program is saved in .txt files for each session

_behavioral video files_ - data from 2 high-speed cameras acquire pupil and whisker/licking data for each session

## Current Status

| Step         |   | Status        |
| ------------ | - | ------------- |
| preprocessing|   | Complete      |
